# Metropolitan-Transport-Authority-Analysis
    The goal of the analysis is to assess the recovery rate of ridership across Metropolitan Transport Authority (MTA) services after COVID-19 pandamic.
    For this analysis we were considered following seven services:
         Subway service, Access-A-Ride, Buses, Bridges and Tunnels, Metro-North, Staten Island Railway and Long Island Rail Road.

 # Data cleaning:
    The dataset required minimal cleaning for this challenge. However, some nomalization was neccessary, as the original dataset consisted of a single table. To streamline the analysis the data is devided into several tables like pre-pandamic data, post-pandamic data, category and date table. 

 # Tool 
     Power BI used for data visualization and analysis.

 # Results
     The Recovery Rates (%) and their trends shows an upward trend across all services, indicating a gradual rebound in ridership, while NYC Bridges and Tunnels remains steady with passenger volumes slightly above pre-pandemic levels.
